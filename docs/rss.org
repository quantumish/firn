*Purpose:* Firn is able to provide basic RSS functionality. This document provides information for setting up RSS for your Firn site.

*Prerequistes*: an understanding of [[file:layout.org][layouts]].

* Overview

*Note*: RSS is still a feature in development, and so there may be breaking changes to how it's developed.

* Usage

In your [[file:configuration.org][config.edn file]] you can enable RSS like so:

#+begin_src  clojure

{;...
 :enable-rss?      true        ; If true, creates a feed.xml in _site.
 ;...
#+end_src


Then, in your [[file:layout.org][layouts]], you will need to specify a css class of ~rss~ *for the container of which represents the content to be part of your feed*.

The following example represents a simple layout of a site and where the rss class might be applied.

#+begin_src clojure
(defn default
  [{:keys [render partials] :as data}]
  (let [{:keys [head nav footer]} partials]
    [:html
     (head data)
     [:body
      [:main
       ;; this should not be in the Rss feed
       [:aside#sidebar.def-sidebar.unfocused
        (render :sitemap {:sort-by :firn-order})]

       ;; ! - This [:article ...] class is the only thing that should constitute a RSS feed's content.
       ;; and so we add a `.rss` class to it so that firn can collect this content specifically for your feed.
       [:article.def-content-wrap.rss
        (render :file)]
       ]]]))
#+end_src
